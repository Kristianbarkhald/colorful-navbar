# Colorful sidenav

I got inspired to make a colorful side navigation bar by a website I visited.
Im sure you can find a lot easier ways to do something like this, but it was more of a fun project.
I used some random icons from: https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery, for the color mixing when you hover over a section.

The gif got a bit laggy, and the navbar looks smoother when you try it out yourself.
The side-navbar looks like this:
